# mura-object-detection

Object detection on bone x-ray images from MURA dataset

## Setup

Tensorflow usage based on https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## Trained Model

From [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V7sa2gpdz2vez1tpn4xVghrM7V-V8cjX?usp=sharing) download the
pretrained model and save it directly to `resources\object_detection\model`. Now you should have a directory like
`exported_ffrcnn_01` under the `model` directory.
